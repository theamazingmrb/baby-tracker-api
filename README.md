# Baby Tracker API

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A comprehensive API for tracking baby activities including feedings, diapers, sleep, growth milestones, and more. Built with Django REST Framework.

## ðŸš€ Open Source Baby Tracking Solution

Baby Tracker is a privacy-first, self-hostable solution that gives parents complete control over their baby's data. Track all aspects of your baby's development and get AI-powered insights to help establish healthy routines.

## Features

- **Baby Management**: Create and manage baby profiles
- **Activity Tracking**:
  - Feedings (breastfeeding, bottle, solid food)
  - Diaper changes
  - Sleep sessions
  - Growth milestones
  - Doctor appointments
  - Medications
  - Pumping sessions
- **AI Insights**: Get recommendations for feeding times and sleep patterns based on historical data

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/api/babies/` | Baby management |
| `/api/feedings/` | Feeding tracking |
| `/api/diaper-changes/` | Diaper change tracking |
| `/api/sleep/` | Sleep tracking |
| `/api/growth-milestones/` | Growth milestone tracking |
| `/api/appointments/` | Doctor appointment management |
| `/api/medications/` | Medication tracking |

## Building a Custom Frontend

This project provides a robust API but does not include a user-facing frontend application for tracking babies. The included Next.js application serves as documentation only. To create a functional baby tracking application, you'll need to build your own frontend.

### Getting Started with a Custom Frontend

1. **Choose a Framework**: React, Vue, Angular, or any other frontend framework
2. **Authentication**: Implement JWT authentication flow using the `/api/auth/` endpoints
3. **Core Features**: Build UI components for:
   - Baby profiles
   - Feeding tracking
   - Diaper change logging
   - Sleep tracking
   - Growth milestone recording
   - Doctor appointment management

### API Integration Example

```javascript
// Example React code for fetching baby data
async function fetchBabies() {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  const response = await fetch('http://your-api-url/api/babies/', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });
  return await response.json();
}
```

### Mobile Considerations

Consider building a mobile-first interface or even a native mobile app, as parents often need to log events quickly on mobile devices while caring for their baby.

## Getting Started

```bash
python manage.py test
```

To run tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

### Test Structure

Tests are organized by feature and API endpoint, located in each app's `tests/` directory:

- Authentication tests
- Baby management tests
- Activity tracking tests (feeding, sleep, diaper changes, etc.)
- Recipe management tests
- AI insights tests
- Visualization tests

Each test file focuses on a specific model or feature, with comprehensive coverage of:
- CRUD operations
- Authentication and authorization

## Security Features

### Multi-Tenancy

This API implements complete tenant isolation to ensure data security in a multi-user environment:

- **Permission Control**: Custom `IsTenantUser` permission class ensures users can only access their own data
- **Query Filtering**: All API endpoints filter data based on the authenticated user
- **Validation**: Serializers validate that users can only create/modify data for their own babies
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Tenant isolation is verified through extensive test coverage

This multi-layered approach guarantees that users can only view and manipulate their own data, making the API safe for public deployment.

## Deployment Options

### AWS EC2 Deployment with Docker Compose (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy Baby Tracker to production is using AWS EC2 with Docker Compose:

1. **Launch an EC2 instance**:
   - Use a t3.nano instance (sufficient for most use cases, ~$5-6/month)
   - Select Amazon Linux 2023 or Ubuntu Server
   - Configure security group to allow HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), and SSH (port 22)
   - Create or use an existing key pair for SSH access

2. **Connect to your instance**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-ip
   ```

3. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   # For Amazon Linux 2023
   sudo yum update -y
   sudo yum install -y docker
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   
   # Install Docker Compose
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

4. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theamazingmrb/baby-tracker-api.git
   cd baby-tracker-api
   ```

5. **Create and configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your production settings
   # Make sure to set DJANGO_DEBUG=False and update PRODUCTION_DOMAIN
   ```

6. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

7. **Create a superuser**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. **Access your application** at http://your-instance-ip/ and the admin interface at http://your-instance-ip/admin/

### Local Docker Deployment

For local development or self-hosting on your own hardware:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theamazingmrb/baby-tracker-api.git
   cd baby-tracker-api
   ```

2. Create an `.env` file from the example:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

3. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Create a superuser:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. Access the API at http://localhost:80/api/ and admin interface at http://localhost:80/admin/

### Documentation Site Deployment

The project includes a Next.js documentation site that can be deployed separately:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the documentation site:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Start the documentation server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the documentation at http://localhost:3000/

Alternatively, you can deploy the documentation site to a service like Vercel or Netlify for production use.

**Note**: This frontend is for documentation purposes only and does not provide a user interface for the baby tracking functionality. Developers using this API would need to build their own frontend application to interact with the API endpoints.

### Custom Deployment Options

While the EC2 + Docker Compose method above is recommended for simplicity and cost-effectiveness, you can deploy Baby Tracker on any platform that supports Docker or Django:

- **Other Cloud Providers**: GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.
- **Kubernetes**: For more complex, scalable deployments
- **VPS/Dedicated Server**: Any server that can run Docker
- **Platform as a Service**: Heroku, Render, Railway, etc.

Key configuration for any production deployment:
- Use PostgreSQL database
- Configure proper environment variables (see below)
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Set up regular database backups

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be configured for deployment:

- `PRODUCTION_DOMAIN`: Your API backend domain (e.g., api.example.com or EC2 IP address)
- `FRONTEND_DOMAIN`: Your frontend application domain (e.g., app.example.com)
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of origins allowed to access the API
- `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS`: Set to 'True' to allow all origins (not recommended for production)
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `SECRET_KEY`: Django secret key (use a strong, random value)
- `DJANGO_DEBUG`: Set to 'False' in production

These variables should be set in your `.env` file for Docker Compose deployments.

### Production Considerations

- **Domain Setup**: To use a custom domain, configure DNS to point to your EC2 instance IP and set up Nginx or use AWS Route 53
- **HTTPS**: For production, set up SSL/TLS using Let's Encrypt with Certbot
- **Backups**: Set up regular PostgreSQL database backups (the database is stored in Docker volumes)
- **Monitoring**: Consider adding basic monitoring for your EC2 instance
- **Updates**: To update your application:
  ```bash
  cd baby-tracker-api
  git pull
  docker-compose down
  docker-compose up -d --build
  ```
